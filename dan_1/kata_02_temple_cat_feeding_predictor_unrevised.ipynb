    "In the quiet hours before dawn, as you sweep the temple courtyard, you notice something peculiar. **Suki**, the sacred temple cat, appears at the feeding bowl with uncanny precision - never too early, never too late, always exactly when their hunger reaches the perfect threshold.\n",

But the true art lies not in knowing this truth, but in teaching a neural network to discover it. This is your first lesson in the sacred art of **gradient descent**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He gestures toward the feeding bowl. \"Your task is to create a mystical artifact - a neural network that can predict Suki's exact hunger level based on hours since their last meal. Master this, and you will understand the fundamental flow of gradients through the sacred tensor realms.\"\n",
