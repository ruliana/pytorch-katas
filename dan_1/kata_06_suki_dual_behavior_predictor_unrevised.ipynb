    "## 📜 THE CHALLENGE\n",
    "\n",
    "Master Pai-Torch sits in contemplative silence, observing Suki's graceful movements around the temple courtyard. \"Grasshopper,\" the ancient master finally speaks, \"you have learned to predict single truths - when Suki will eat, whether doors will stick, which ceremonies are occurring. But observe closely: Suki's behavior contains not one mystery, but two intertwined enigmas that dance together like yin and yang.\" The master's eyes gleam with ancient wisdom. \"She exists in distinct modes - the focused hunter tracking temple mice, and the serene napper basking in sunbeams. Yet within each mode, her energy pulses with varying intensity, from barely stirring to explosive action.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The ultimate Dan 1 challenge awaits you: create a single neural network that can simultaneously classify Suki's behavioral mode AND predict her activity intensity level. You must learn to weave together the discrete art of classification with the continuous flow of regression, understanding when to use each approach for different aspects of the same phenomenon. This is the sacred dual nature of machine learning - knowing both what category something belongs to, and how much of that category it embodies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 THE SACRED OBJECTIVES\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **Master Multi-Output Networks**: Build a single model that produces two different types of predictions\n",
    "- [ ] **Understand Classification vs Regression**: Learn when each approach serves different aspects of the same problem\n",
    "- [ ] **Combine Different Loss Functions**: Calculate separate losses for classification and regression outputs\n",
    "- [ ] **Interpret Dual Predictions**: Understand how to read and validate both categorical and continuous outputs\n",
    "- [ ] **Visualize Complex Relationships**: Create plots that show both discrete categories and continuous values\n"
