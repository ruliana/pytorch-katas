        "Master Pai-Torch sits in contemplative silence beside the temple's sacred feeding bowl, watching Suki the temple cat's daily rituals. \"Young grasshopper,\" the master begins, \"observe how Suki appears at this bowl with mysterious precision. Yet beneath this feline mystery lies a pattern as ancient as the mountains themselves. The wise temple keepers have long known that a cat's hunger grows steadily with each passing hour, following a sacred mathematical harmony.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Your first trial as Temple Sweeper is to decode this sacred relationship,\" Master Pai-Torch continues, stroking their chin thoughtfully. \"Through the mystical arts of linear regression, you must learn to predict when Suki's hunger will compel her to appear at the feeding bowl. Master this simple relationship, and you will have taken your first step toward understanding the deeper mysteries of neural networks. But beware - even the most basic patterns require disciplined practice to master.\"\n",
