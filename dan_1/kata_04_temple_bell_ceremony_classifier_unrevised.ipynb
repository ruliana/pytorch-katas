    "## 📜 THE CHALLENGE\n",
    "\n",
    "Master Pai-Torch sits in the temple's bell tower, surrounded by four ancient bronze bells that have rung for centuries. \"These sacred bells have marked the rhythm of our temple life for generations, Grasshopper. Each ceremony—morning meditation, noon contemplation, evening reflection, and midnight transcendence—requires its own unique tone.\" The master's weathered hands gesture toward the bells, each showing the patina of countless ringings. \"But time and weather have changed their voices, and even the most experienced monks sometimes struggle to identify which ceremony should begin when they hear a bell's call.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your task is to restore this lost wisdom,\" Master Pai-Torch continues, eyes twinkling with the promise of hidden knowledge. \"Using only the pitch frequency of a bell's tone, you must create a neural oracle that can distinguish between all four ceremonies. This will teach you the art of multi-class classification—how a single feature can reveal multiple truths, and how the softmax function transforms raw predictions into the language of probability and decision.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 THE SACRED OBJECTIVES\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this kata, you will:\n",
    "- [ ] Master multi-class classification with PyTorch\n",
    "- [ ] Understand softmax activation for probability distributions\n",
    "- [ ] Implement cross-entropy loss for multiple classes\n",
    "- [ ] Learn to interpret class probabilities and make confident predictions\n",
    "- [ ] Practice single-variable feature classification\n",
    "- [ ] Understand the difference between binary and multi-class classification"
