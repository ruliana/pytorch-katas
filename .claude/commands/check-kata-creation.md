**Think hard** about conducting a comprehensive validation of the most recently created PyTorch kata. This command performs a thorough quality assurance check against all requirements from CLAUDE.md and the sacred temple standards.

## Validation Mission

You must conduct a complete inspection of the most recent kata creation to ensure it meets all sacred temple requirements. This is a critical quality control step before the kata can be considered ready for disciples.

## Step-by-Step Validation Process

### 1. **FIRST: Identify the Most Recent Kata**
- Use git log or file timestamps to find the most recently created kata file
- Look for files with `_unrevised.ipynb` suffix
- Confirm the file exists and is a valid Jupyter notebook in proper JSON format
- Check that it contains properly formatted cells, not raw markdown text
