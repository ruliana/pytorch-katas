    "\n",
    "**Master Pai-Torch**: \"Grasshopper, you have mastered the simple linear arts, but now you seek the deeper mysteries. The temple archives contain scrolls of immense power - some authentic treasures from the founding masters, others clever forgeries created by those who would steal our sacred knowledge.\"\n",

This knowledge is forbidden to those who lack proper discipline. Without the Sacred Safeguards, even the wisest student falls to the Curse of Overfitting.\"\n",

    "- [ ] **Optimization Arts**: Use advanced optimizers beyond simple SGD\n",
    "- [ ] **Guardian's Vigilance**: Detect and prevent overfitting through early stopping\n",
    "- [ ] **Threshold Mastery**: Optimize decision boundaries for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Master Pai-Torch**: \"Remember, young guardian - a model that achieves perfect accuracy on training data but fails on new scrolls is no guardian at all. True wisdom lies in generalization, not memorization.\""
